# Occasional Idiot
## Browser plug-in hides your friends' occasional idiotic posts

Your friends are great. You love them. But every now and then, they can be total idiots.

Maybe your roommate is an otherwise normal person, except she's obsessed with Middle East politics. Or your hometown BFF is a professional party planner who spams you with event promotions. Or that cutie you met at the Duke away game is really cool as long as you don't get him started on LGBTQ issues. Or your buddy from college struck it rich in Silicon Valley and now posts about OWS and the Koch Brothers... from the side of the 1%. Or maybe you just want your girlfriend to stop spilling <i>Game of Thrones</i> spoilers.

You don't want to unfollow or block them &mdash; they <i>are</i> still your friends, and they <i>do</i> still talk about normal things. You just want to steer clear of their particular trigger topics.

#### 4. Highlight a trigger word

Select a word or phrase from their post or comments that indicates that your friend is talking about one of their personal nutcase topics.

Poof! All gone! <i>Occasional Idiot</i> will invisibly hide your friend from any conversations that include the trigger word. Your friend's posts and comments are automatically removed from your feed any time...
* Your friend makes a post or comment using the trigger
* Your friend chimes in with a comment on a thread where the original post used the trigger
* Anybody else posts a comment with the trigger hoping to goad your friend into an off-topic rant 

!["Screenshot from Facebook, just like the original but with the vaccines post missing."](/gfx/sampleworkflow/screenshot-fb-no-more-vaccines.png?raw=true "'No more posts from John about vaccines! Much better! Now, to get him to shut up about chemtrails and the Greece bailouts...'")
