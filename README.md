# Occasional Idiot
## Browser plug-in hides your friends' occasional idiotic posts

Your friends are great. You love them. But every now and then, they can be total idiots.

Maybe your roommate is an otherwise normal person, except she's obsessed with Middle East politics. Or your hometown BFF is a professional party planner who spams you with event promotions. Or that cutie you met at the Duke away game is really cool as long as you don't get him started on LGBTQ issues. Or your buddy from college struck it rich in Silicon Valley and now posts about OWS and the Koch Brothers... from the side of the 1%. Or maybe you just want your girlfriend to stop spilling <i>Game of Thrones</i> spoilers.

You don't want to unfollow or block them &mdash; they <i>are</i> still your friends, and they <i>do</i> still talk about normal things. You just want to steer clear of their particular trigger topics.
